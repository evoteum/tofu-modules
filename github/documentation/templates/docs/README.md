# Documentation for ${REPOSITORY_NAME}

This directory contains documentation for the ${REPOSITORY_NAME} repository.

It may include:
- Project guides and manuals
- API documentation
- Any other relevant documentation

It may _not_ include:
- application source code.
- files for GitHub Pages.

In the [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) spirit of “Working software over comprehensive documentation”, remember that the best documentation is the code itself. Aim to provide “just enough” documentation to guide users and contributors without overwhelming them. Focus on clarity, relevance, and maintainability. Documentation should complement the code rather than duplicate it.

When writing documentation, remember that understanding the reasoning behind choices is just as valuable as knowing how to implement them, so link to ADRs where applicable.
